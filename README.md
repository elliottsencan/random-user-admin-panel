# Random User Admin Panel

Random User Admin panel is a React app built with Create React App, Redux, CircleCi, Material UI, AWS, LocalStorage, and Lodash.

The application will fetch a random user from https://randomuser.me/api/1.0/, display profile information, and save that user's ID to LocalStorage.


### Building project:
1. Clone the project from Github
2. In your terminal from the app's root directory run `npm i`
3. Start the app with `npm run start`
4. Re-generate documentation by running `npm run doc`
